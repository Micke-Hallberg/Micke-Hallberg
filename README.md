- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Micke-Hallberg
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning programming and electronics. Since I had a total blackout some years ago and forgott most of what I once knew, I am learning from beginning again.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to program ESP-32 modules. I am using Arduino IDE, I needed something simple to use and got myself an Arduino starting set and from there I went on to
  what I found a bit mor interesting, nothing bad with Arduino boards, they ar wondeful, but lacked what I realized I really wanted to tinker around with, network and BT. Used to work a lot with network as a
network engineer and programmer and teacher in both subjects. 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me? E-mail is the simplest way I think? micke@tcpig.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: Forgetts as easy as I learn. If it is fun? not really but others seems to find it fun.
